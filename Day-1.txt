Devops:-a group of S/W we are going to install in the linex operating system which are from the AWS server.

*)as a devops engg you need to take care Build(need to convert .exe file) and deployment and monitor.
*)Server:-high config computer we called as a server.
AWS Cloud
----------
*)Cloud:-someone maintaining the server somewhere in the world but we are able to access through the internet
*)EC2:-Elastic compute cloud.amazon elastic computing cloud is a web service that provides a resizeble compute capacity in the cloud and
       it reduces the time to launch the instances and allowing you to quick scale capacity,scale up and down. 
url for aws cloud:-aws console

AWS Terminologies:-
------------------
*)OS   -AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
*)CPU  -
*)RAM  -
       //note:-if they provide one CPU then they will provide 1GB of RAM for 2 CPU-4GB RAM for 4 CPU-8GB like that they will provide till
               128 cpu-4000GB RAM. and we will call this "instance type"(CPU+RAM).
*)Hard Disc:-EBS(Elostic Block Storage)
       //note:-we have two types of storages
               1)block:-it is like C drive in your laptop you can install any s/w and you can store anything
               2)Object:-it is like D drive in your laptop you cannot install any s/w you can only store the data.
*)computer -instance

*)Scalable:-in this we have two things one is scale up and scale down.
            scale up:- means if you have a laptop with 4GB RAM and 1TB if you want more than this like you need 32GB RAM and 4TB ROM
                       it is possible in EC2.
            scale down:-32GB RAM and 4TB ROM TO 4GB RAM and 1TB called scale down.
*)Advantage
-----------
1)On-Demand:-they will give what you ask(if you want 32GB RAM 2TB RAM )
2)Scalable
3)Pay as you go:-it is like a power bill or internet bill if you use 2 instance for 2 hr you will get less bill if you use 200 instances 
                 for 2 hr you will get more bill.

Launch Windows Instance:
------------------------
login aws->all services->EC2->launch instance->name and tag           ->creat key pair(it will download PEM file)
                                               amazon machine image
                                               instance type

*).pem file will have encrypted data  
*)in instance you need to select which one you need to run after this you need to click on connect element there you will find "RDP client"
  in RDP client you will find computer name or ip address and password 
*)at password you have one option called get password then you need to browse the pem file and click on open then you will find decrypt
  click it you will get password.
*)you need to open remote desktop connection there you need to fill ip adress username and password.
*)you will get one window operating system.if you want to close the os you need to click on "X".even though you closed the OS it will 
  run for that you need to come to the instance there you will find instance state->stopinstance.
