*)OS:-it is a interface b/n user to computer.there are only 2 os are available.
*)WINDOWS:-1)not for free
           2)not open for the world which means whatever the language used to create the windows os they will never exopse to the world.
           3)user friendly.easy to learn.
           4)multiple users and multiple tasks are possible but we have limit in users
           win 98,win xp,win vesta,win 8,win9,win 10-->micro soft released OS
           win 2012,win 2016,win 2018, win 2019-->web servers.
*)UNIX   :-invented by linus tolvalds and he wrote LINUX.since it is a free so IBM took the code they developed AIX,HP-->HP-ux,Apple-->mac os,
 -------   Sun micro-->sun solaries

           1)free to install
           2)open to the world
           3)not user friendly,difficult to learn.
           4)light weight(consumes less resourcess which means it will take less Ram and provides high speed)
           5)secure form hacking and virus.

stucture of files and folders(file system hyrarche)
----------------------------------------------------
Windows--C-program files                               Linux--/-root
          -program files X84                                   -home
          -usera                                               -bin-->commands(both as a user and admin can use the all commands)
          -windows                                             -sbin-->some of the commands(only admin can exicute all)
                                                               -boot-->os related files.
                                                               -etc-->all configurations related files.
                                                               -usr-->all s/w's are installed in this folders.

*)when you open your windows CMD the default location is C:/Users/Admin.if you want to go back you need to use command "cd .." and if you
  want to go any folder then "cd name of the folder" here cd means change directory.
*)when you open your linux CMD as a administator your default location is /root.and if you open as a normal user your default location is
  /home.and all file which are belongs to Operating System those files in boot folder.
*)when you turn on your computer since from that moment to till you see your screen in that period whatever the process happend that 
  process is called booting process in this process all inactive files comes to active state.the files which are belongs to operating 
  system they will test themselfs this is  post(power on self test).
*)"/" top level root directory.in linux
*)after launching your linux instance you will be a ec2 user which mean your a normal user if you want to exicute all linux commands
  you have to be a adminstrator so to swich to normal user to administrator you need to use command "sudo su" enter and "cd ../.." this 
  command used to go top level root directory.
*)"ls"command used for to know all folders present in the instance.
