*)it is a configuration management tool.configuration means how many users and groups in your instance and what are the permission
  and what are the files and folders and s/w packages,services,ip/ports are present in your instance.these things managed by the
  ansible tool.here management means add,edit,delete,append.
*)administrator or linux peoples can do this manually as a devops engg you need to automate these all using tools like ansible,
  puppet,chef,salt stack.
*)all configuration management tools internally follows IAC(infrastructure as code) concept.the process of converting code into 
  infrastucture which is known as IAC.
*)iac means we will write a code for creating 1000 users and 500 groups in a file and we will exicute this automatically it will
  creat those things.
*)whatever the code we will write in a file that is repetable,testable(internally it will test),versionable(commit id's are versions).

Configuration management:-
--------------------------
*)it is a method through which we will automate admin works.configuration management tool will turns your code into infrastructure.
  so your code should be repetable,testable,versionable.

*)if you didn't use CMtool then cost is high due to manpower,time taken for install s/w,slow,lot of time to update.
*)if you use CM tool it is totally automating it will take less time to create users,to update,reduce downtime,improve performance.
  it will prevent the errors,reduce the cost.

why ansible:-
-------------
*)• Ansible is an administration tool. What ever system admins (Linux/windows) used to
do manually, now we are automating all those tasks by using Ansible (Any CM Tool)
• Can use this tool whether your servers are in on-premises or in the cloud.
• It turns your code into infrastructure i.e your computing environment has some of the
same attributes as your application:
• Your code is versionable.
• Your code is repeatable.
• Your code is testable.
• You only need to tell what the desired configuration should be, not how to achieve it
• Through automation, get desired state of server.
Why Ansible?

• Other tools in the market can be really complicated ..
o huge overhead of Infrastructure setup
o complicated setup
o Pull mechanism
o Lot of learning required
• Pros of Ansible :
 Agentless
 Relies on ssh
 Uses python
 Push mechanism

*)i will create one instance in that i will install the ansible then it will become a ansible server.
*)i will creat one file in that instance that file is nothing but "playbook" in this book we will write YAMEL scripting language
*)now i will creat 3 instancess one for anseble server others are hosts i will establish the connection b/n anseble server to 
  hosts through ssh.
how to download and install ansible:-
-------------------------------------
*)first we need download epel repository.inside of the repo you will see git,ansible,python,python-pip,python devel,openSSL.
*)steps:-download epel repo
         install epel repo
         update OS
         install all s/w one by one.
*)in second step we installed epel it doesn't meen it will install all s/w which are in epel repo.after update os your instance 
  will recognize epel s/w.
*)if suppose wget not installed in your computer then you need to install "yum install wget -y".but now i am using amazon linux
  os so no need to install.

step-1
------
*)"wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm" and enter.
step-2
------
*)"yum instal epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm -y" enter.
step-3
------
*)"yum update -y" enter.
step-4
-------
*)"yum install git python python-devel python-pip openssl ansible -y" enter.this will install all s/w at a time.

Video-36
--------
*)when you install ansible in your instance it will create two files automatically 1)ansible.cfg 2)hosts file (or) invventory 
  file.
*)those files will available in "/etc/ansible" folder.
*)inside of inventory file we will mention hosts ip adress that's why we will call inventory file as hosts file.if suppose we 
  have 2 hosts or clients we are going to mention those hosts ip adress inthe inventory file.
*)all entry's of hosts file will available in the ansible.cfg file in the commented form so we need to uncomment that one.

////uncomment in ansible.cfg

*)open ansible.cfg file "vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg" you will find "#inventory= /etc/ansible/hosts" so you need to uncomment 
  this one click on i and remove #. you need to uncomment one more also that is "#sudo-user = root". :wq enter.
*)now my OS will understand hostfile.

////mention client ip adress in hostfile

*)open hostfile "vi /etc/ansible/hosts" ther you will find examples of groups below click i to insert creat any group and go to client instance
  take private ip adress.
  [webservers]
  IP adress of host1
  IP adress of host2 and save it.
*)if you want to call 1st client then "webservers[0]" index always start with zero.if you want to call 2nd client "webserver[1]"
*)ex:-if you have 50 client instancess then call 1 st =groupname[0]
                                                 50th =groupname[49] or groupname[-1] //-1 means first from last
                                                 45th =groupname[44] or groupname[-5]
*)ex:-if you have 50 client instancess you need to call first five instancess
                                             first 5  =groupname[0:4]
                                        call 10 to 20 =groupname[9:19]
*)ex:-if you have 2 group and eachgroup have 50 
                  call 2nd one in G1 and 7th one inG2 =G1[1]:G2[6]

*)here we need to use some admin linux commands

////we need to follow 4 steps

  1)create common user
  2)set password
  3)sudo privilage to common user means giving all permissions
  4)establish ssh connections b/n two computers.by default it will ask password
  5)ssh connections with out password
  //note:-first 4 steps you need to do in h1,h2,server as a root user.last step you need to do in server as a ansible user.
*) i am creating user in ansible server,h1,h2 with the name of ansible "useradd ansible"
   and password "passwd ansible" enter it will ask you to set password type and enter it will ask retype password type and enter.
*)now we sucessfully created username and password in server,h1,h2.
*)now switch root user to ansible user "su - ansible" enter.
*)now we are ableto create any file or folder as a ansible user but here your unable to install the s/w if you type 
  "yum install httpd then it will show you like this :-you need to be a root user to perform this command
*)if you give as a normal user"sudo yum install httpd -y" it will ask password if you enter password it will give msg like 
  :-ansible is not in the sudoers file. the incident will be reported.
*)so you need to give permission for the ansible user.only root can access the sudoers file.after giving permission ansible user 
  also able to open this file.that is the main drawback with this sudoer file.at a time multiple users can access this file.
  that's why redhat peoples created "visudo" file this file can allow one after othe user.
*)opening sudoers file is not recommendable.if two users are working same time one user metined some username and other person 
  delete those username at same time confussion will occure.
*)"visudo" to open file some where you will find ##allow root to run any command any where.
  click on i to insert below root "ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" save and exit.this will give all permmissions and it don't
  ask the password.
*)switch to ansible user "su - ansible" and try to install httpd service "sudo yum install httpd -y" it will download.and it won't
  ask the password.
*)now we need to establish the ssh connection b/n server to h1,h2
*)"ssh privateIpAdressOfTheHost" to establish connection b/n server and host you need to type this in server terminal.it will
  ask you to type yes and enter.it will show permission denied.
*)so before doing this you need to do some modifications.
//note:-establshing ssh connections it does't mean connection b/n server instance to host instance it is a connection b/n 
        server ansible user to host ansible user that's why we need to give user name same in both.

Video-37
--------
////establish connection b/n user to host

*)Syntax for ssh connection "ssh username@PrivateIpAdress".
*)goto ansible user "su - ansible".
*) "ssh privateIP" it will give you error so we need to modify a file.so come out from ansible user "exit".
*)"vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config"
*)in this file we need to uncomment few things then only our os will understand those things.first one is"#PermitRootLogin Yes"
  second one is "#PasswordAuthentication Yes" it will consider first line.
*)after doing this we need to restart the sshd service "service sshd restart"
*)now connect server to host1 "ssh host1privateIP"<--in serverinstance.it will ask password "ansible".
*)"exit" if all ok.
*)now connect server to host2 "ssh host2Ipadress" it will ask password.
*)exit if it all ok.
*)if you want to install any s/w "ssh ipaderss" and "yum install tree" it will show some error so "sudo yum install tree"
  you need to add sudo this will give all permissions to your ansible user like as a root user.
*)exit from host.
5th step:-
----------
*)you need to in sever ansible you need to provide some keys to genarate files "ssh-keygen" it will generate some key files.
*)"ssh-keygen" enter,it will ask tosave file enter,it will ask password (noneed to give)simpli enter again enter.it will save
  rsa file.
*)two files are generated id_rsa,id_rsa.pub.  id_rsa is a private file and id_rsa.pub is a public file which are in /home/ansible/.ssh
  folder.

////generate files and copy in hosts

*)we generated the id_rsa,id_rsa.pub in server now weneed to create .ssh folder in hosts and we need to creat file in .ssh folder
  the file name is "autherized_keys".now we need to copy paste the data which is in id_rsa.pub.
*)we need to do it manually so we will do mistakes so we have a command to do that "ssh-copy-id ansible@hostprivateIP" this one
  will creat .ssh folder and authorized_keys in the host automatically.for the first time it will ask password.

Video-38
--------
*)whenever you launch the instance "whoami" it will show you as a ec2-user this is a normal user.previously you created a ansible
  user if you want to switch normal user to normal user then "su - username" then it will ask you the  password you need to enter
  the password.
*)total 3 ways to write the code.
  1)ad-hoc commands(simple linux commands)
  2)module(single module)
  3)playbook(<=1 module)
*)no idenpotencity concept in ad-hock we will see this concept in rest one's.idenpotencity means use code for one time only.

//// see three waysof code

*)"su - ansible" and to see what are the hosts in your server "ansible all --list-hosts" itwill show you the IP adress of hosts.
*)to see groups and hosts in the server "vi /etc/ansible/hosts"
*)if you want to call all "ansible webserver --list-hosts"
*)               call 1 st one "ansible webservers[0] --list-hosts"  
*)               call 2 nd one "ansible webservers[1] --list-hosts"
*)               call last one "ansible webservers[-1] --list-hosts"
*)               call 2nd last one "ansible webservers[-2] --list-hosts"

*)being in server instance i want to see files and folders in host1,host2 "ansible groupname -a "ls" ".
*)if you want to see hidden files also "ansible groupname -a "ls -al" ".
*)if you want to see what are the folder and files in home folder in both hosts "ansible groupname -a "ls /home" ".
*)if you want to creat any folder or file in both hosts under toplevel roor directory "ansible groupname -a "touch myfile" ".
*)to install s/w "ansible webservers -a "sudo yum install tree". this will install s/w in h1,h2
*)to verify "ansible webserver -a "sudo which tree" ".
*)if you want to install httpd s/w in h1 only from server computer "ansible webservers[0] -a "sudo yum install httpd -y" ".
*)if you want to creat any folder in h2 only "ansible webservers[1] -a "touch myfile" ".

//note:-if you grt error like you need to be a root user then you need to  mention "sudo".till now we saw simple linux commands.this
       is ad-hoc commands in this we don't see idenpotencity concept which means if you exicute any command to creat file or folder
       which is alredy exicuted it will creat the folder agin.

Video-39
--------
///using single module

*)now if i want to install a software in both hosts from server computer using this module "ansible webservers -b -m yum -a "pkg=httpd state=present" ".
  here "-b" is module "become root" "-m"means module which module "yum" module. in general yum is a linux command but ansible people
  they made it like that."pkg=httpd" means s/w and "state=present" means install.

*)now i want to update."ansible webservers -b -m yum -a "pkg=httpd state=latest" ". if you see the o/p in yellow colour it is exicuted successfully if 
  you see o/p in green colour it didn't exicuted.

*)now i want to uninstall s/w."ansible webservers -b -m yum -a "pkg=httpd state=abscent" ".

*)now i want to start the service."ansible webserver -b -m service -a "pkg=httpd state=started" ".

*)now i want to restart the service."ansible webservers -b -m yum -a "pkg=httpd state=restarted" ".

*)now i want to stop the service."ansible webservers -b -m yum -a "pkg=httpd state=stoped" ".

*)now i want to creat user."ansible webserver -b -m user -a "name=vishnu state=present" ".

*)now i want to delete the user."ansible webserver -b -m user -a "name=vishnu state=absent" ".

*)we have some default actions user->name->present
                               file/folder->name->create
                               yum->pkg ->install
                               service->start.

*)ex:-i want to create one user."ansible webserver -b -m user -a "name=phani" ". here no need to give "state=present" by default it
      will take that.

*)ex:-if you have 2 groups (webservers,gang) nou you need to install httpd in both groups."ansible webservers:gang -b -m yum -a "pkg=httpd" ".
     or "ansible all -b -m yum -a "pkg=httpd" ".

*)in above command if you don't want to mention "-b" then you need to mention "sudo".

*)now i want to copy a file in the server and i need to paste in hosts "ansible webservers -b -m copy -a "src=filename dest=path" ".

*)now i want to see setup details of the hosts."ansible webservers -m setup".it will give lenghthy o/p.

*)now i want to see ip adress in the setup "ansible webservers -m setup -a 'filter=*ipv4*' ".it will show you the ip adress of hosts.

*)in very rare condition we will use the ad-hoc commands and single module commands for one time activity.in companys we will use playbook

////playbook

*)we will creat a file in the server computer and we will write some code in the file this file we will called as playbook if we exicute
  playbook then result will appere in the hosts.we will use YAML language in playbook.

YAML(Yet Ain't Markup Language)
-------------------------------
*)indentation mean gap.

*)For Ansible, nearly every YAML file starts with a list
*)Each item in the list is a list of key/value pairs, commonly called a "dictionary"
*)All YAML files have to begin with "---" and end with "...
*)All members of a list lines must begin with same indentation level starting with "- "

--- # A list of tasty fruits
fruits:
- Apple
- Orange
- Strawberry
- Mango
...

*) A dictionary is represented in a simple key: value form (the colon must be followed by a space)

--- # An employee record
Employee:
name: SAI
job: DevOps Engineer
skill: Elite
...
PlayBook
---------
*)Each playbook is composed of one or more ‘modules’ in a list

*) Playbooks are divided into many sections like....
*)Target Section - Defines the hosts against which playbooks tasks has to be executed
*)Variable Section - Defines variables
*)Tasks Section - List of all modules that we need to run, in an order

////creat dummy playbook


*)"vi test.yml" when you creat playbook then you need to give the extention ".yml".

--- # i want to exicute few thing     //this line my computer can not understand because of #
- hosts: webservers
  tasks:
           - name: install httpd service on webservers
             action: pkg=httpd state=installed
           - name: installed tree srvice on groupname
             action: pkg=tree state=installed

*)if you want to exicute this playbook "ansible-playbook test.yml"

Video-40
--------
////creat and exicute one playbook

*)creat a file in your server "vi target.yml" .open it and write data.

--- # this is target section for my understanding purpose i am writing
- hosts: webservers
  user: ansible
  become: yes # this means giving permissions
  connection: ssh

*)save it and exicute it "ansible-playbook target.yml" it will show you some o/p.in this
  you will found "TASK [Gathering Facts]" this means whatever the entrys will happen in hosts it will give all info to the server.
  you will fin "ok IP" it means your server able to connect host.

*)you will get that data in setup.

*)now i would like to exicute one task.then you need to creat file "vi task.yml"

--- # this is task playbook
- hosts: webservers
  user: ansible
  become: yes
  connection: ssh
  tasks:
         - name: installing httpd in webservers
           action: yum name=httpd state=installed

*)this one will give o/p.
*)if you didn't give [ : or indentation] currectly then you will get syntax error.
*)if i add ignore_errors and i exicuted with below code.

--- # this is task playbook
- hosts: webservers
  user: ansible
  become: yes
  connection: ssh
  tasks:
         - name: installing httpd in webservers
           action: yum name=htt state=installed
           ignore_errors: yes

*)it will failed to install the httpd service.
*)creat a file "vi vers.yml". in this we will see the variable concepts.

--- # this is vars sections
- hosts: webservers
  user: ansible
  become: yes
  connection: ssh
  vars:
         pkgname: httpd

  tasks:
         - name: install httpd on webservers
           action: yum name='{{pkgname}}' state=installed
*) in above file we have 3 sections 1.target section 2.variable section 3.task section.

////now we will see dependency tasks

*)till now we saw main or direct tasks but now we will see dipendency tasks which meen installing httpd is main task but if you want
  to start the httpd service this is dependency task for this you need to install httpd first.
*)create one file "vi handler.yml"

--- # this is handler playbook
- hosts: webservers
  user: ansible
  become: yes
  connection: ssh
  tasks:
            - name: installing httpd on webservers
              action: yum name=httpd state=installed

            - name: start httpd service
              action: service name=httpd state=started

*)Scenorio:-now httpd service is inactive position turn off httpd service. if you exicute the above code again then it will go to the
  first action it's alredy installed so it will goto the second action and it will turn on the httpd service.it can not install httpd
  s/w agin because it will follow the idenpotensity concept.

*)now you dont want that if it exicute 1 st action then only it need to exicute 2 nd action. for that you need to add dependencys
  in playbook.

--- # this is handler playbook
- hosts: webservers
  user: ansible
  become: yes
  connection: ssh
  tasks:
            - name: installing httpd on webservers
              action: yum name=httpd state=installed
              notify: start httpd service

  handlers:

            - name: start httpd service
              action: service name=httpd state=started
*)exicute this.after httpd service off now it won't turn on.because of indentency concept httpd service alredy installed so it can not
  install that again so it can't go to next activity because of dependency.

//// how to remove your bill.

*)"ansible-playbook handler.yml --check" enter. "--check" means it can't exicute in the hosts but it will show you final o/p.

                     - Rohit
                     - Rithika


*)in above code we used loops concept first it will creat one user and after this it will search for the second user.like that.

*)after exicuting this one you will see depreciation warning in your if you don't want that then "sudo vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg"
  click on i and go any where and "deprecation_warnings=False" type this and save it.and if you exicute it one more time you can't
  get those lines.

Conditions:-
------------
//note:-you have server and 10 hosts (5centOS,5 ubuntu) in playbook if you mention module as "yum" then s/w will install in centOS
        hosts only other hosts they can't understand if you set as "apt-get" then it won't work in the centOS.so here you need to set
        some conditions.if it is a centOS host then don't exicute "apt-get" or if it is a "ubuntu' then don't exicute "yum".

Vault:-Storing sensitive data.
-------
*)by using the vault we can encrypt the data.we can do that in two ways.
  1)while creating the playbook we can do this.
  2)we can dothis with existing playbook.

////encrypt the data

*)while creating playbook.after enter it will ask new password and confirm password.
  "ansible-vault creat name.yml"

*)now if you open this file "vi name.yml" you can see the data in encrypted format.if you want to edit this then
  "ansible-vault edit name.yml" this one will ask the password which you entered above provide that password and enter.

*)now if you want to change the password for the above file it will ask old password,new password,confirm password.
  "ansible-vault rekey name.yml"

*)now the data is not secret any more you want to allow for everyone to see that data.now you need to decrypt the data.
  "ansible-vault decrypt name.yml" it will ask the password.

////now see how to encrypt the data with the existing playbook.

*)take existing playbook and make encrypt
"ansible-vault encrypt name.yml"

ROLES:-creating multiple playbook inside one playbook.we need to cegrigate all.
-------
*)roles concept will availble in chef,ansible,jenkins etc..

*)adding more functionalities to the playbook is difficult to understand so we need to divide in to boxes.

//note:-in roles concept you must follow one rule that is you must name your folders and files as he said in your company also
        for my understanding i am writing this.

////exicute ROLES concept

*)creat a folder "mkdir passbook".//must give passbook
*)inside of the passbook folder creat one file and one folder which will have sub folders
  file --> "touch /home/ansible/passbook/master.yml"
