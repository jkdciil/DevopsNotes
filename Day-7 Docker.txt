*)docker is all about OS-level virtualization and it follows union file system and layered architecture.
*)Container:-it is a vertual machine or computer.
*)here if you have one computer then you need 5 more computers and you don't have money to purchase then you need to install one
  s/w that is VMware created by vmware company (or)oracle virtual box created by oracle.by using theese s/w on our H/W->OS->we
  need to install VMware->os of vm->s/w.
*)if you have a computer have 12GB ram and 1Tb of rom your computer taking 2 GB ram and 200gb of rom with the help of VMware we
  we will creat 4 computers in theese computers we will distribyte the 2GB ram and 200 GB of rom for every computer that's how we
  will make one computer to 5 computers.and here mandatorly you need to install os in 4 computers which you created.
*)in docker the base computer OS must be linux.here we need to creat containers on the top of base computer.and here no need to 
  install os in the containers.
*)the major advantage with the docker is no need to specify H/W components and no need to install OS and no need to specify Rom.
*)even though you installed docker the container will take os,ram,rom but those were neglegible.
*)docker people created a online repository that is docker hub which will have images which is nothing but OS(5%).
*)if you take Base instane have h/w components and on that you will have RHEL(red hat enterprise linux) which is 95% OS.and you need 
  to install docker s/w above that create containers to creat containers you need to download docker image which you want like 
  cent os,fedora,amazon linux. here the containers will use 95% of os from base instance only and it willuse 5% os from dockerimage
  this concept we will call os level Virtualization.and docker container are less weight it will take less space.
*)Docker:-it is a tool which will perform the Operating System Level virtualisation also known as a containerization.
          (or)it is a tool which is used to creat virtual machines.

*)layered archetechture means one s/w will appere on the top of other s/w this structure we will call layered archetechture.
*)if you download image from hub.docker and you created one container in that container you installed different types of s/w.
*)and you want to follow every one in your team like this formate them you need to creat a image(OS+S/W+folders+file) and you
  need to share that document to all teamates they will download and they will install.now every one container had same version
  of s/w and same files and folders this is called union file system.
*)Benfits with the docker
• Containerization (OS level virtualization)(No need guest OS)
• No pre-allocation of RAM
• Can replicate same environment
• Less cost
• Less weight (MB’s in size)
• Fast to fire up
• Can run on physical/virtual/cloud
• Can re-use(same image)
• Can create machines in less time.
*)docker components:-1)docker image
                     2)docker container
                     3)docker file:- describe steps to creat docker image.
                     4)docker hub:-stores all docker images publicly.
                     5)docker daemon:-docker service.
*)daemon means background service.
ways to creat docker image
--------------------------
*)take image from docker hub.
*)creat image from existing docker container.
*)creat image from docker file.

Video-29
--------
*)creat one instance and launch it and docker is alredy downloaded s/w so you just need to install it "yum install docker" and
  you need to start the service."service docker srart".
*)"docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash" we are using docker that's why "docker" and "run" means creat container by using "ubuntu" 
  image."-it" means interactive the terminal.
*)linux OS will have lot of shells like c shell k shell and bash shell bash is a advanced shell.
*)"docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash" enter.to creat container.
*)"docker ps" it will show you only running container.whenever you exit from your container please enter this command.
*)"docker images" it will show you how many images you downloaded.
*)docker ps -a" it will show you all container details.
*)"docker search ubuntu" this one will search in online.
*)"docker run -it chef/chefdk /bin/bash" to create container with the help of chef.
*)if you don't want to creat any container and you need to download s/w then "docker pull jenkins" or you can go to hub.docker
  select jenkins image there you will find command to exicute in your terminal.
*)if you want to rename your container then "docker rename oldname newname".
*)if you want to give the name at the time of creating container "docker run -it --name vishnu ubuntu /bin/bash" it will creat 
  container name with vishnu.
*)when you exit from container it will stop the container again you need to start the container "docker start name(or)containerID".
*)if you want to go inside of the container "docker attach name(or)containerID.
*)to stop "docker stop name(or)cID.
*)if you want to remove any container "docker rm name"
*)//note:-if you want to go inside of conainer then you need to start the container and if you want to remove the container 
          first you need to stop the container and you need to remove it.
*)"cat /etc/os-release" to check the OS.

Video-30
--------
*)if any s/w not installing then you need to update the docker container "apt-get update"
*)"apt-get install apache2" for ubuntu os(debian family) this is for installing httpd service.while installing it will ask you 
  about region(select region number) and time zone(select zone number and enter).
*)"apt-get update -y" to update the container.
*)and creat a file in /tem/myfile and come back.
*)now we need to creat one image.if you use this image in other container then the container will have the myfile and tree s/w
  and httpd s/w in that new container.

////create imge wit the help of existing container.

*)"exit" to come out from container. and to creat image from existing container "docker commit oldcontainer imageName".
*)by this command we will create our own image.

Other way to creat image:-
--------------------------
*)by using docker file.
*)dockerfile:-a text file with instructions to build an image.automation of docker image creation.we will give small instruction
  like FROM,RUN,CMD.
*)"pwd" to see where are you
*)come back to ec2-user and creat a filename "Dockerfile" here D should be capital and inside of the folder
  FROM ubuntu
  RUN echo "message" > /tmp/testfile
  RUN apt-get install apache2
  Run apt-get install tree
*)save it.
*)"docker build -t imagename ." this one will creat a image.here "." means it will take docker file only.
*)"docker images" to check how many images we have.

Video-31
--------
*)Docker Volumes:-it is a directory in your container.firstly diclare directory as a volume and share the volume with other container
  and eventhough your container in stop possition you can able to access the volume.and you need to declare volume while creating
  container only.you can't create any volume after creating container.you can share this volume with n number of containers.
*)you can map volumes in two ways
      1)share host-container 
      2)share container-container
*)to creat volume you need to do few changes in the Dockerfile
    FROM ubuntu
    Volume ["/data"]
*)you need to creat image "docker build -t imagename ."
*)creat container "docker run -it --name containername imagename /bin/bash"
how to share volume:-
----------------------
*)create container1 "docker run -it --name container1 -v /tmp/name ubuntu /bin/bash"
*)till now we created one container only.you need to create 2 nd one so we need to add some thing while declaring the container
  "docker run -it --name container2 --volume-from container1 ubuntu /bin/bash".
*)and you need to give all permission for container2 about volume so
  "docker run -it --name container2 --privileged=true --volumes-from container1 ubuntu /bin/bash"
*)exit
*)if you create any file in container2 then data will appear in container1 also.

*)create containe3 "docker run -it --name container3 -v /vish ubuntu /bin/bash"
*)creat container4 by taking reference from container3
  "docker run -it --name container4 --privileged=true --volumes-from container3 ubuntu /bin/bash"
*)create one file in c4 it will appear in c3.

//note:-above concept is share container-container.

share host-container:-
----------------------
*)create one container and declae a volume while creating the container.
  "docker run -it --name container5 -v /home/ec2-user:/vishnu ubuntu /bin/bash"
*)if you creat any file in c5 it will appearin the base computer.exit.
*)"docker inspect container name" this command will give you the json format output search for "mounts" ther you will find 
  (destination="folder)is the special folder i mean volume.

---------
*)Port Maping or port export:-
------------------------------
*)Scenorio:- create one ec2 instance and create one container and add data in that container now i want to expose that data to
            the world in general we will install httpd service and we will expose the data with the help of public ip address
            but in containers we don't have ip adress it will have ports.you need to open port for each container and you need 
            to map with container port then you will get response.
*)creat ec2 instance and creat container
 "docker run -td --name container7 -p 80:80 ubuntu"
  here d means detached if you don't want to go inside of the computer then we will use "d". "-p" represent the port and "80:80"
  first 80 is base computer port and second one for container.no need to give /bin/bash.
*)now i want to go inside of the above container "docker exec -it conyainer7 /bin/bash" now i need to interact with container so
  i mentioned "-it" and /bin/bash
*)update your container "apt-get update -y"
*)install apache2 package "apt-get install apache2 -y"
*)start service "service apache2 start"
*)go to var folder you will find www folder -> you will find html->index.html(default file) "cd /var/www/html"
*)creat one file "echo "hi pandu" > vi.html"
*)if you want to see data which is inside index.html then take publc ip from ec2 instance and google it.if you want to see data
  of vi.html then "public ip:ec2 port number/vi.html" you need to google it.
*)if you want to creat other container then you need to open other port in ec2 instance
  "docker run -td --name container7 -p 90:80 ubuntu".

HUB.docker:-
------------
*)"docker images" to see the all images in your container.
*)"docker login" it will ask username and password.
*)if you eant to upload any image initially you need to reserve some place in your hub so
  "docker tag imagename hubUsername/newnameofIMAGE" it will generate refference image in your container.
*)now you need to push the image to hub "docker push hubUsername/newnameofimage".
*)now goto hub.docker and refresh it.you will find the image.
*)now creat other instance in other region and creat container with the help of the that image you uploaded in hub.
*)install docker and start the service and pull the image from dockerhub "docker pull newimagename" and creat other container
  "docker run -it --name pariscon newimagename /bin/bash".
*)till now the image is public any one can download the image but i want to download the image only my team members then goto 
  setting click make private.
*)to delete image "docker rmi imagename".
*)now creat container with heip of same image it will show you the error so you need to provide login details of hub in paris 
  instance and you need to pull the image.
*)if you want to stop all in docker like containers images then "docker stop $(docker -a -q)"
*)if you want to remove container "docker rm $(docker -a -q)"
*)for removing images "docker rmi $(docker -a -q)"
*)inside sha256 algarithem we are following.
*)for demon container we need to open ports in ec2 (sequrity group->edit inbound rules->add rule->custom ctp,90,ipanywher v4->
  save it.
