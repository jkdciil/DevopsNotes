*)apache company created mave.
*)it is a build tool with this tool we will convert raw source code into executable file like .jar , .war , .exe , .json  ..etc.
*)build:-compile+assemble+create delivarable.
         compile:-convert source code to machine redable formate.
         assembly:grouping all .class files
         deliverable: .war,.jar
*).war file contains lot of jar files and html file and etc.
*).ear(enterprise archive) file contains lot of .war file and html file and jar files etc.

Q)how to do night time build activity in cmd?

*)build tools:-• C, C++ : Make file
               • .Net : Visual studio
               • Java : Ant, Maven

*)archetechture of maven:-• Main configuration file is pom.xml
                          • One project - One workspace - One pom.xml
                          • Requirements for build:
                                 • Source code(Present in workspace)
                                 • Compiler(Remote repo - local repo - Workspace)
                                 • Dependencies(Remote repo - local repo - Workspace)

*)maven build life cycle:-1. Generate resources ( Dependencies)
                          2. Compile code
                          3. Unit test
                          4. Package (Build)
                          5. Install (in to local repo & artifactory)
                          6. Deploy (to servers)
                          7. Clean (delete all run time files)
                            eg: mvn install
                                mvn clean package

                          1-6 -> Default & Sequence order
                          7 -> Not Default & It won’t follow sequence

*)maven reository:-• Local (.M2)
                   • Remote (https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/)

*)imp points in maven:-• Maven is all about plug-ins
                       • Snapshot: Indicates development copy of your project. Not the one which you are
                         going to release.
                       • eg: 1,0-SNAPSHOT
                       • If you see version no in place of snapshot, then it means product is ready to give
                         customer.

*)multi module project:-• Simply dividing project into modules
                        • Each module must have it's own SRC folder & pom.xml so that build will
                          happen separately
                        • To build all modules with one command, there should be a parent
                          pom.xml file. This calls all child pom.xml files automatically
                        • In parent pom.xml file, need to mention the child pom.xml order.
