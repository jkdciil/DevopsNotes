*)Web Server:-A bundle of Web Pages or group of web pages

*)STEPS FOR WEB SERVER
  1)Launch the instance
  2)Install the web s/w
  3)load web files
  4)start the service

*)first you need to creat the instance in aws
*)open putty and enter ip address and click on ssh+ and click on auth and browse the ppk file and click on ok
*)by using linux commands you need to install web s/w
      "sudo su"   enter
     
      "cd /var"  enter
      "ls"    enter to see all folders in your system

      "yum install httpd -y" enter  after enter chech folders now you will find the one new folder called [WWW] to check that you need to 
       enter "ls"  and inside of that folder one htmt folder will exist
      "cd www" enter
      "ls" enter this will show you all folders present in the www folder

      //if you write anything in side that html folder that will appear while you browse.
     
      "echo "VISHNU VARDHAN" > index.html" enter this command will write that name inside of the html folder
*)now we need to start the service.
      "service httpd start" enter to start the web service.now it is started.

*) to check we need to go to the aws instance->instance id->copy Public IPv4 address and open chrome and google it.you will get error why
  becuase you opend input port but you haven't open output port yet so it will take your request but it don't give any response.you will 
  get site can't reached right now so you need to do some settings in your instance.
*)after click on instance id scoll down little bit you will find option called "security"->security groups->edit inbound rules->add rule->
  type(http),source(anywhere). and save.
*)now you google the public ip of your instance you will get what you wrote.
*)ssh port:-we use to go inside of linux server physically and run some linux commands
*)http port:-we use to access web site through internet.

*)ssl:-secure socket layer.

*)Status Check
--------------
1)instance status check
2)system status check

*)actually we will see in status check as 2/2 passed but in least casess we will see 1/2 passed that means "System Status check" got passed
  but Instance status check is failed.0/2 passed means system status check is failed and instance .
  1/2:-you need to reboot the instance.goto instance state->reboot instance.By clicking on the reboot option entire OS will reloaded there 
       will be no loss of data.
  0/2:-you need to restart which means stop and start the instance.By clicking on stop/start the entaire VM migrated to another physical 
       machine and here also your not going to loss your data.

*)Whenever you will get putty floating error then you need to change few settings.
  open putty->connection->seconds there you will find number (Default sec 00)->make ti 30.->session->Deafult settings->save.
*)if you didn't touch your command prompt for 2,3 min the fattle error will accour.when you mention 30 then your putty will restart for 
every 30 sec.so it will never go to inactive.

Protect from accedental termination:-
-------------------------------------
Selct instance->Actions->Instance settings->Change Termination protection->Enable->Save.
*)while creating the instance you will find advance settings there you will find termination protection there you need to select enable.

Quick launch Instance:
-----------------------
*)here you need to select AMI only no need to select instance type and all those things and select review and launch option then it will 
  go to final stage and creat the instance.and select the instance and click on the connect there you will find the EC2 Instance Connect.
  the AWS will provide putty in onlie directly so no need to open putty and no need to enter user name and password and all those things.
*)why we need to install putty and putty gen in our laptop even though aws providing those?
  -->>this is not user friendly.if you didn't use the terminal for 5 or 10 min then it will go to inactive.while doing small works only we
      priffer this.

Regions(countrys)&availability zones:-
--------------------------------------
*)if you have existing innstance you will find the option called availability zone.while creating the instance if you didn't select any
  specific zone then it will take default zone but if you want specific zone then you need to select specific zone while you creating the
  instance.
*)while ceating instance you will find option called "Subnet"->select dropdown->choose zone.
*)to avoid network latency problem choose nearest zone.
