  and deliver/deploy to the client.this process is called CI-CD
*)intigrate:-combine all code writtten by developer till some point of time.
*)build:-compile the code and make a small executable packeges.
*)test:-test in all environments whether app is working or not.
*)archived:-stored in a artifactory so in future we may use again.artifactory means .exe or .war file like that.
*)delivery:-handing the product to the client.
*)deploy:- installing product in client's machine.

*)jenkins work flow:-once developers complete coding they will push the code to github.jenkins will pull the code and
                     it will send that code to maven for build once it is ready then build will send for testing after
                     completion of testing jenkins will send that code into artifactory.

Sheduled projects:-
-------------------
*)we have two options in this 1)build periodical 2)poll Source Code Manegement(pull)

Build Periodical:
-----------------
*)if you want to do periodically it means if you want to execute the code at a specific time then you need to click on
  nameofjob->configure->build triggers below you will find build periodically select check box it will open a box if 
  you mention "*****" first * reperesents minitue and second * reperesents hours and third * reperesents a day in the

*)apply and save it will exicute.
*)if you want to stop that exicution then you need to deselect build periodically checkbox.

Poll SCM(pull)
--------------
*)the purpose of this option is jenkins will pull the code for every one minitue if any changes happen in github repo
  then only it will exicute the jobso you nee to select this poll scm checkbox.goto build triggers below you will find
  the option.
*)the difference b/n with build periodical and poll scm is build periodicall will visit github and exicute the job
  but poll scm will visit the github and it will exicute only if any changes happen in repo.

linked/related jobs:
--------------------
*)in this we will find 1)up stream 2)down stream.

*)up stream:-i will creat 2 jobs i will exicute one job after exicuting that it need to trigger other one also.

  need to mention "jobB" it will show error at below so you need to click on back space after name. apply and save.

*)if you want to creat one more slave then it will provide the option for copy the all setting from slave1.like
  copy existing node.
*)when you run job all one after other quickly then it will share some jobs to slaves.after exicution goto c:\ there
  you will find slave1 folder.
